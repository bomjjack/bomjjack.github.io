## Privacy Policy

Effective date: October 26, 2018

Everjinsoft ("us", "we", or "our") operates the SimpleDaysOn mobile application (the "Service").

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

### Information Collection and Use

For users who purchase our apps directly through Apple (App Store, Mac App Store, Volume Purchase Program), we do not collect and do not have access to your customer data (Apple manages it directly).

We do not collect nor have access to any payment information such as credit cards.

The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

### User-Generated Content

We do not collect user-generated content. Our apps process all kinds of user-generated content (photo, video, audio, text, geotag…) on users’ behalf, and, in that context, they may require or optionally need photo / microphone / geolocation / device sensors / access to user generated contents. This information is solely processed to provide standard photo capture, video capture (with sound), speech recognition, and photo/video geotagging or other editing features. These personal data remain private on the device at all times unless cloud storage, cloud processing, collaboration with other users are used, or a cloud syncing option (iCloud, Dropbox, or other explicitly mentioned solution) is knowingly initiated by the user. Our apps may explicitly require access to your Dropbox, Evernote, iCloud account or any other cloud storage account (at your request) to provide specific features. Our apps may access, process, update your cloud storage data on your behalf, but our apps do not use or access this data otherwise and we do not have any access to it. No sharing of personal data is performed without user consent other than through specific user-initiated actions. In cases where we need to store user-generated data on a server to provide a specific feature (such as multi-user collaboration), we design it so that we cannot access your data (data is stored encrypted, and the encryption key is not shared with us).

### Security Of Data

We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Service Providers

We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

### Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

### Children’s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
